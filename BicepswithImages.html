                When facing biceps tendon pathology, patients and surgeons must choose between two primary surgical approaches: tenotomy and tenodesis. This comprehensive guide provides evidence-based insights with visual references to help understand these critical treatment decisions.

            <h2>Understanding Biceps Tendon Anatomy</h2>
            <p>The long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT) originates from the superior labrum and travels through the bicipital groove of the humerus. When this tendon becomes damaged due to repetitive stress, age-related degeneration, or acute injury, surgical intervention may be necessary to restore function and eliminate pain.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Understanding this anatomy is crucial for appreciating why both tenotomy and tenodesis can effectively address biceps pathology, albeit through different mechanisms and with varying outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Surgical Technique Comparison</h2>
            
            <div class="comparison-section">
                <h3>Tenotomy Approach</h3>
                <p>Biceps tenotomy involves simply cutting the long head biceps tendon at its attachment to the superior labrum. This releases the damaged tendon, allowing it to retract down the arm where scar tissue forms naturally.</p>

                <p><strong>Procedure Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minimally invasive arthroscopic approach</li>
                    <li>Procedure time: 10-20 minutes</li>
                    <li>Immediate pain relief through tendon release</li>
                    <li>Natural healing through scar tissue formation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="comparison-section">
                <h3>Tenodesis Approach</h3>
                <p>Biceps tenodesis involves cutting the damaged portion of the tendon and then reattaching the healthy portion to a new location on the humerus, typically using screws, anchors, or other fixation devices.</p>

                    <li>Can be performed arthroscopically or through small open incision</li>
                    <li>Procedure time: 30-45 minutes</li>
                    <li>Preserves biceps length-tension relationship</li>
                    <li>Requires fixation hardware for tendon reattachment</li>

                <h3>Clinical Research Findings</h3>
                <p>Multiple high-quality studies have compared outcomes between tenotomy and tenodesis, providing valuable evidence for surgical decision-making.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Research Findings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Patient Satisfaction:</strong> Tenotomy 91% vs. Tenodesis 96% (Aflatooni et al., 2020)</li>
                    <li><strong>"Popeye" Deformity:</strong> Tenotomy 43-47% vs. Tenodesis 9-33% (van Deurzen et al.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Cramping Incidence:</strong> Tenotomy 20% vs. Tenodesis 8% (Aflatooni et al., 2020)</li>
                    <li><strong>Return to Activity:</strong> Tenotomy 2-4 weeks vs. Tenodesis 3-6 months</li>

            <h2>Recovery Timeline and Expectations</h2>
            <p>Understanding the recovery process is essential for setting appropriate patient expectations and optimizing outcomes.</p>
            
            <!-- Recovery Timeline Image -->

                Figure 6: Recovery timeline comparison showing key milestones for both procedures from surgery through full recovery
            </div>
            
            <p>The recovery timeline differences significantly impact patient selection. Tenotomy offers faster return to activities but with potential cosmetic changes, while tenodesis requires longer rehabilitation but better preserves biceps function and appearance.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Decision-Making Factors</h2>
            <p>The choice between tenotomy and tenodesis should be individualized based on multiple patient factors:</p>

            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Patient Selection Criteria:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Younger patients (&lt;60) often benefit from tenodesis</li>
                <li><strong>Activity Level:</strong> High-demand athletes typically prefer tenodesis</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmetic Concerns:</strong> Patients concerned about appearance favor tenodesis</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery Time:</strong> Those needing quick return may choose tenotomy</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Comorbidities:</strong> Complex medical conditions may favor simpler tenotomy</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Both biceps tenotomy and tenodesis represent effective surgical options for addressing long head biceps tendon pathology. The choice between procedures should be made through shared decision-making, considering individual patient factors, activity demands, and personal preferences.</p>
            
            <p>Recent research demonstrates high patient satisfaction rates with both approaches, though each carries distinct advantages and limitations. Understanding these differences, visualized through anatomical illustrations and outcome data, enables more informed treatment decisions and better patient outcomes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> There is no universally "better" procedure—only the right procedure for each individual patient based on their unique circumstances and goals.</p>
