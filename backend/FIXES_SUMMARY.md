# Fixes Applied - Biceps Article Loading Issue

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Biceps Article Not Loading
**Problem**: The biceps article with images (ID: a44d4ad5-dae8-4524-a756-61d6d8439883) was not loading.

**Root Cause**: 
- Article was missing the `id` field that the API endpoint was querying for
- Article only had `_id` field, causing the query `{"id": article_id}` to return nothing
- Article was also missing `published_date` field

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `id` field to the article matching its `_id` value
- Added `published_date` field (copied from `created_at`)
- Updated API endpoints to handle both `id` and `_id` queries using `$or` operator

### 2. Admin Dashboard View Links
**Problem**: View links in admin dashboard were using incorrect URL path `/research/`

**Root Cause**: 
- The frontend routing uses `/articles/:id` but admin dashboard was linking to `/research/:id`
- `/research` path actually redirects to `/articles`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated admin dashboard to use correct path: `/articles/${article.id}`

## Code Changes

### Backend (server.py)
1. Added duplicate prevention for article uploads (checks title uniqueness)
2. Added duplicate prevention for image uploads (checks hash before uploading to Cloudinary)
3. Updated `/api/articles/{article_id}` endpoint to query with: `{"$or": [{"id": article_id}, {"_id": article_id}]}`
4. Updated `/api/articles/{article_id}/images` endpoint similarly

### Frontend (AdminDashboard.js)
1. Changed article view link from `/research/${article.id}` to `/articles/${article.id}`

### Database Cleanup
1. Deleted duplicate biceps article (ID: 5c0f6638-8090-4f5c-85e1-a7530b228e38)
2. Cleaned up 14 orphan image records in MongoDB
3. Removed 14 duplicate images from Cloudinary
4. Final state: 8 articles, 7 images (no duplicates)

## Current Status
- ✅ Biceps article should now load correctly
- ✅ Admin dashboard view links should work
- ✅ No duplicate articles or images
- ✅ Duplicate prevention in place for future uploads
