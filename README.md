# 🧬 Arthrokinetix
**Revolutionary platform where medical research meets emotional intelligence and algorithmic art**

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/kpjmd/arthrokinetix-website)

## 🎯 Overview

Arthrokinetix is a groundbreaking dual-purpose platform that combines:
- **Evidence-based medical research education** (orthopedic surgery & sports medicine)
- **Algorithmic art generation** from emotional analysis of medical literature  
- **Community-driven emotional intelligence AI** that evolves based on user feedback
- **NFT minting integration** with smart contract routing on Base L2
- **Social sharing ecosystem** for medical content and algorithmic art

## 🎨 Phase 2B Features in Detail

### 1. Enhanced Emotional Feedback System

**Algorithm Influence Logic:**
```javascript
// Real algorithm state updates
const updateAlgorithmWithFeedback = async (emotion, influenceWeight) => {
  // Get current emotional mix
  const currentMix = algorithmState.emotional_mix;
  
  // Apply weighted influence (max 30% per feedback)
  const influenceFactor = Math.min(influenceWeight * 0.2, 0.3);
  
  // Update emotional balance
  newMix[emotion] += influenceFactor;
  
  // Normalize and save new state
  const newState = normalizeEmotionalMix(newMix);
  await saveAlgorithmState(newState);
  
  return { algorithmInfluenced: true, newDominantEmotion: emotion };
};
```

**User Experience:**
- Immediate visual confirmation of algorithm influence
- Different messaging for access tiers (demo/subscriber/NFT holder)
- Beautiful success animations with algorithm learning indicators

### 2. Social Sharing Integration

**Platform-Specific Optimization:**
- **Twitter**: Character limits, hashtag strategies, medical content formatting
- **LinkedIn**: Professional tone, evidence-based emphasis, network appropriate
- **Facebook**: Engaging descriptions, visual appeal, community sharing
- **Reddit**: Community-friendly formatting, subreddit appropriate content
- **Email**: Professional templates with medical disclaimers

**Sharing Modal Features:**

- Platform-specific icons and branding
- Copy-to-clipboard with success feedback
- Mobile-responsive design

### 3. NFT Minting Integration

**Smart Contract Routing:**
```javascript
// Automatic contract selection based on rarity
const getContractInfo = (artwork) => {
  const rarityScore = artwork.metadata?.rarity_score || 0;
  const isUnique = rarityScore > 0.8;
  
  return {
    contract: isUnique ? 
      "0xb976c398291fb99d507551d1a01b5bfcc7823d51" : // ERC721
      "0xc6ac80da15ede865e11c0858354cf553ab9d0a37",  // ERC1155
    type: isUnique ? 'ERC721' : 'ERC1155',
    label: isUnique ? 'Unique' : 'Edition',
    manifoldUrl: `https://manifold.xyz/${contract}`
  };
};
```

**NFT Information Panel:**
- Contract type and rarity scoring
- Network information (Base L2, low gas fees)
- Algorithm metadata (version, emotion, generation parameters)
- Direct Manifold integration for seamless minting

### 4. Legal Compliance Framework

**Healthcare-Specific Content:**
- Medical disclaimer requirements for healthcare blogs
- Professional consultation advisories
- Educational use only clarifications
- Evidence-based content limitations

**NFT Rights Framework:**
